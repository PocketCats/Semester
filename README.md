Problem we try to solve/Way we try to solve problems:
1) Problem of unclear and/or unstructured educational process
    [] Creating roadmap of subject, with points of interests (POI), that will contain all materials, hw and docs that will help student on order to success
2) Problem of communication between student and professor (what should be done, how and when? Which papers or documents should be used in order to solve? How particular problem can be solved more easily?)
    [] Allowing student to asking questions about particular lecture note, hw or doc
3) Problem with marks management
    [] Integrate system with other university solutions

Flow:
1) Administration create subject and assign professor
2) Administration or professor assign students and assistants (unlimited)
3) Professor create point of interests (POI), add description to it, timers (if required), articles, video, files, links (etc.)
4) Students participate in POI, pass homework, watch videos, read articles, etc.
5) Professor or assistant rate every student's activity

Features:
1) Each subject can be archived and reviewed later  (after course is over or complete)
2) Each subject has discussion board, so common question can be moved to board and be answered once
3) Every POI has discussion and history of changes
4) Embedded code editor and code execution, so professor could see result
5) Integration with other system, so marks could be exchanged
6) Administration could form group (set of students), and assign all of them to course
7) Simple domain interpreter should be included, so professors and assistant could write scripts in order to improve quality of their work
8) Personal schedule for deadlines, and suggestion how easy do something
